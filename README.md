# Notice
If you are seriously considering to add "THE FOOD-WARE LICENSE" to your project, you should consider another license like [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) and [Apache-2.0](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0) in the same way. Because this license is not approved by [OSI](https://opensource.org/) and [FSF](https://www.fsf.org/) unfortunately. I cannot atone for any possible damage.

However, this license is not a joke. I'm welcome to your foodüç£üçªü•© present ;)
